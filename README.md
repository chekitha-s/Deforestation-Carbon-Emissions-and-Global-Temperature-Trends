This project explores the relationship between deforestation, carbon emissions, and global temperature rise through interactive visualizations. Using Datawrapper charts, it illustrates:

Deforestation vs. Afforestation: How forest loss far exceeds replanting efforts.

Impact on CO₂ Levels: How reduced forest cover accelerates carbon buildup in the atmosphere.

Temperature Trends: How rising CO₂ contributes to global warming over time.

The goal is to make climate data more engaging and accessible, helping users understand the urgent need for sustainable environmental practices.
