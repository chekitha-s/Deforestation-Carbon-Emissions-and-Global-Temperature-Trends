# Deforestation, Carbon Emissions, and Global Temperature Trends
## An Interactive Data Visualization

### Overview
This project tells a data-driven story about how global deforestation contributes to rising carbon dioxide levels and, ultimately, to higher global temperatures. Using interactive visualizations embedded from Datawrapper, the project weaves together multiple datasets into a cohesive narrative that connects environmental change with its planetary impact. All charts are designed following the rules of effective visualization — consistent color usage, clear font hierarchy, and accessibility-oriented design choices. 

### Features
1. Interactive map of afforestation vs. deforestation.
2. Line chart showing the link between deforestation and rising CO₂ emissions.
3. Time-series visualization illustrating the global increase in average monthly temperatures.
4. Narrative-driven layout to guide the viewer through cause-and-effect relationships.
5. Graphs adhere to visualization best practices (color, font hierarchy, and clarity).

### Tech Stack
HTML/CSS – page structure and styling
Datawrapper – embedded interactive charts
JavaScript snippets – responsive resizing of iframes

### How It Works
1. The first chart highlights how afforestation efforts can’t keep pace with ongoing deforestation.
2. The second visualization demonstrates how this drives rising carbon dioxide concentrations worldwide.
3. The final chart shows how elevated CO₂ contributes to the rise in global average temperatures over time.
Together, these graphs create a storyline of environmental cause and effect, while maintaining consistency with visual design principles.
